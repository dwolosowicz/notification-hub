# Notification Hub
It's a simple demo project protected by JWT Authorization, exposing a RESTful API allowing the user to dispatch notifications through various platforms (eg. Slack, e-mail or RocketChat).

## Current stage
As this is a demo project, currently it consists of fundamental entities on the database level, API covering them, documentation and security layer.

Integrations with third-party platforms and notification processing are yet to be implemented so this project can't be seen as fully functional.
